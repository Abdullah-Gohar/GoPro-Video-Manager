# GoPro Video Manager

**GoPro Video Manager** is a tool designed to simplify the organization and management of GoPro video clips. The software renames traditional GoPro file names like `010134.mp4` into more human-readable formats, such as `November 16, 2024 06_55.MP4`, making it easier to browse, access, and edit your footage.

### Key Features
1. **File Renaming**: Converts GoPro's default file names into timestamp-based names.
2. **File Merging**: Combines GoPro's segmented video files into a single, high-quality clip, retaining all frames and quality.
3. **Audio Merging (Experimental)**: Merges external audio clips associated with video files, where applicable.
4. **File Restructuring**: Organizes clips into folders based on their capture date and time.

> **Note**:  
> The audio merging feature is still experimental, and renaming `.WAV` files associated with individual clips may not always work as intended.

## Software Guide

### Getting Started
1. Run the script using the instructions above.
2. Use the app interface to select the folder containing your GoPro exports.

### Main Functions
1. **Restructure Files**:  
   Groups all clips shot together into a single folder and renames them to the time and day of their original capture. This is the default behavior when a folder is selected and the "Run" button is clicked.

2. **Merge Files**:  
   When the "Merge Files" option is selected, the app groups clips as described above and merges multiple clips from a folder into a single video file.

3. **Delete Clips** (Optional):  
   An optional flag for merging. When enabled, all individual clips that were merged are deleted, leaving only the merged video file.

4. **Reverse Split**:  
   Reverts the default restructuring process. All files are pulled from their folders and placed into the root directory, retaining their timestamp-based names. Merged files remain merged.
